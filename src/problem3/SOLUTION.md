### Troubleshooting Steps for High Memory Usage on a VM Running NGINX Load Balancer

#### Step 1: **Verify Monitoring Data**
- **Action**: Confirm the accuracy of the monitoring tools by cross-checking memory usage using command-line tools.
- **Commands**:
  ```bash
  free -h
  top
  htop
  ```
- **Expected Outcome**: Ensure the memory usage reported by the monitoring tools matches the output of these commands.

#### Step 2: **Identify Processes Consuming Memory**
- **Action**: Identify which processes are consuming the most memory.
- **Commands**:
  ```bash
  ps aux --sort=-%mem | head
  ```
- **Expected Outcome**: Determine if NGINX or other processes are consuming excessive memory.

#### Step 3: **Check NGINX Configuration**
- **Action**: Review the NGINX configuration for any misconfigurations that could lead to high memory usage.
- **Files to Check**:
  ```bash
  /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
  ```
- **Expected Outcome**: Look for settings like `worker_processes`, `worker_connections`, and buffer sizes that might be too high.

#### Step 4: **Check NGINX Logs**
- **Action**: Examine NGINX logs for any errors or unusual activity.
- **Commands**:
  ```bash
  tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
  tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
  ```
- **Expected Outcome**: Identify any patterns or errors that could indicate issues such as high traffic, misconfigured upstreams, or attacks.

#### Step 5: **Check System Logs**
- **Action**: Review system logs for any related issues.
- **Commands**:
  ```bash
  dmesg
  journalctl -xe
  ```
- **Expected Outcome**: Look for out-of-memory (OOM) killer messages or other system-level issues.

#### Step 6: **Check for Memory Leaks**
- **Action**: Investigate if there is a memory leak in NGINX or any other running service.
- **Commands**:
  ```bash
  vmstat 1
  ```
- **Expected Outcome**: Monitor memory usage over time to see if it continuously increases, indicating a potential memory leak.

#### Step 7: **Check for External Factors**
- **Action**: Ensure no external factors are causing high memory usage, such as a sudden spike in traffic or a misconfigured upstream service.
- **Commands**:
  ```bash
  netstat -anp | grep :80
  ```
- **Expected Outcome**: Identify if there is an unusual number of connections or if upstream services are unresponsive.

### Possible Root Causes, Impacts, and Recovery Steps

#### 1. **Misconfigured NGINX Settings**
- **Cause**: Incorrect settings like too many `worker_processes` or large buffer sizes.
- **Impact**: High memory usage leading to potential service degradation or outages.
- **Recovery Steps**:
  - Adjust `worker_processes` to match the number of CPU cores.
  - Optimize buffer sizes in the NGINX configuration.
  - Reload NGINX:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl reload nginx
    ```

#### 2. **High Traffic Load**
- **Cause**: Sudden spike in traffic overwhelming the VM.
- **Impact**: Increased memory usage, potential slowdowns, or service unavailability.
- **Recovery Steps**:
  - Scale up the VM resources if possible.
  - Implement rate limiting or caching in NGINX.
  - Distribute traffic across multiple load balancers.

#### 3. **Memory Leak in NGINX or Other Services**
- **Cause**: A bug or issue causing a service to consume increasing amounts of memory over time.
- **Impact**: Gradual degradation of performance leading to eventual service failure.
- **Recovery Steps**:
  - Restart the affected service to temporarily alleviate the issue.
  - Update NGINX to the latest version or apply relevant patches.
  - Investigate and fix the root cause of the memory leak.

#### 4. **External Attacks (e.g., DDoS)**
- **Cause**: Malicious traffic overwhelming the server.
- **Impact**: High memory and CPU usage, potential service outage.
- **Recovery Steps**:
  - Implement DDoS protection measures (e.g., rate limiting, firewalls).
  - Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic.
  - Contact your cloud provider for additional DDoS mitigation support.

#### 5. **Upstream Service Issues**
- **Cause**: Upstream services are slow or unresponsive, causing NGINX to hold onto connections.
- **Impact**: Increased memory usage due to pending connections.
- **Recovery Steps**:
  - Investigate and resolve issues with upstream services.
  - Adjust NGINX timeout settings to drop unresponsive connections.
  - Implement health checks for upstream services.
